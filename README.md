# Test-Management-System

This application was built to assist a professor to manage and select test questions for students. 
The objective was to keep a record of the semester and year in which each of the test questions were used.
The record also maintained information whether it was used in a quiz, test, assignment, or an exam.
The professor can add new questions to the database by selecting them from test banks and uploading into the system.
The test preparation screen is split into two views, one for the entire list of questions from the bank, filtered by Course and Topic, and the other side displays the selected questions.
Once finalized, the test is then saved into a Word document to be printed for the students.
